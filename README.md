## Time Complexity and Space Complexity:

Sometimes, there are more than one way to solve a problem. We need to learn how to compare the performance different algorithms and choose the best one to solve a particular problem. While analyzing an algorithm, we mostly consider time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Similarly, Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.

Time and space complexity depends on lots of things like hardware, operating system, processors, etc. However, we don't consider any of these factors while analyzing the algorithm. We will only consider the execution time of an algorithm.

Order of growth is how the time of execution depends on the length of the input. In the above example, we can clearly see that the time of execution is linearly depends on the length of the array. Order of growth will help us to compute the running time with ease. We will ignore the lower order terms, since the lower order terms are relatively insignificant for large input. We use different notation to describe limiting behavior of a function.
